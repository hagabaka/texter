texter is a utility to help you modify ruby source programs in order to use gettext.
It searches for string literals, display each and ask you whether it should be
marked as translatable, with _( ). In case the string contains embedded code, it
is able to rewrite it with string modulo operator with your input

USAGE
  texter.rb <input-file> [<output-file>]
output-file is by default named <input-file>.texter.rb

CREDITS
- Daniel Brumbaugh Keeney provided much help with the treetop grammar and rest of
  the program

BUGS
- Quotes in string-like literals are treated incorrectly as string delimiters,
  except in these common cases:
  - regexp /.../
  - %[qQwr], followed by (), [], {} pairs
- Only strings enclosed in ' and " are prompted
- Default answers for yes/no prompts are not working in highline 1.4.0, but patch is
  pending for next release

TODO
- Preview
(following probably too difficult)
- Save and restore progress
- Recover from incorrect parsing
- Undo
